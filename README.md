## INTRODUCTION
 Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly popular due to their lower emissions 
and energy efficiency compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. One of the 
key components of an EV is the battery pack, which provides the power to drive the vehicle's 
electric motor. However, the battery pack's performance and lifespan are heavily dependent on 
its temperature, which must be kept within a safe operating range to ensure optimal 
performance and avoid damage.
To address this issue, a temperature control system for the battery pack is necessary to 
maintain safe operating temperatures. The purpose of this project is to design and simulate a 
temperature controller for an EV battery system of two wheeler EV. The temperature controller 
will monitor the battery's temperature.
The project will involve analyzing the thermal characteristics of the battery pack, 
selecting appropriate temperature sensors, developing a control algorithm to monitor and 
regulate the battery temperature, and simulating the performance of the temperature controller 
under different operating conditions. The simulation results will be analyzed to identify 
potential areas for improvement or optimization.
Ultimately, the goal of this project is to design and simulate an effective and efficient 
temperature controller for an EV battery system that can maintain safe operating temperatures 
and prolong the battery's lifespan.
## LITERATURE SURVEY
 Controller development of thermal management system for electric Bikes [1] .This 
paper proposes an advanced control strategy for thermal management system (TMS) of an 
electric bike (e-bike) to maintain safe operating temperatures of key powertrain components, 
including the battery, inverter, motor, charger, and DC/DC converter. The control strategy 
combines a High-Level Controller (HLC) and a Low-Level Controller (LLC). The HLC 
provides binary commands based on ambient conditions and temperatures of heat generated 
components, while the LLC calculates analog commands using fuzzy inferences and inputs 
such as temperatures of the motor and battery, electric power consumption of pumps, and 
outputs of HLC. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the TMS in managing 
the key components' temperatures and their power consumption under the 
HWFET drive cycle.

 Experimental and numerical investigation on efficient optimization of battery thermal 
management systems [2].This literature provides a novel optimization method for the design 
of parallel air-cooled Battery Thermal Management Systems (BTMSs) used in electric vehicles 
to maintain battery pack temperature. The proposed method simplifies the calculation models, 
reducing multiple variables to be optimized to a single variable, resulting in a much more 
efficient design. The results of this study demonstrate that the optimized systems exhibit better cooling performance than those using previous optimization methods. This proposed method 
shows great potential for efficient structural design of parallel air-cooled BTMSs.
 
  Structure optimization of air cooling battery thermal management system based on 
lithium-ion battery[3]. This paper investigates the use of spoilers to improve heat distribution in battery thermal management systems (BTMS). Two common BTMS are selected, and two novel structures with spoilers are proposed. Three structural parameters are studied, and two optimal BTMS configurations are obtained. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of 
spoilers in BTMS and identify optimal configurations.

 Evaluation of Spoiler Model Based on Air Cooling on Lithium-Ion Battery Pack 
Temperature Uniformity [4].The This paper designed and tested three cooling layouts for 
electric vehicle batteries, with a spoiler-type cooling system outperforming the Z-type and 
heatsink models. The proposed model accurately matched experimental data with a low 
relative error, and further research is needed for real-world applications. The shape and 
location of the spoiler should be considered when implementing this cooling method.

 Battery internal temperature estimation via a semilinear thermal PDE mode[2].This 
paper presents a new method to estimate the internal temperature of a lithium-ion battery in 
real-time, which is crucial for safe and reliable operation. The proposed method uses a 
mathematical model and temperature measurements at the battery surface only, without the 
need for spatial discretization of the model. The method also considers nonlinearity, modeling 
uncertainty, and measurement uncertainty in a single observer design framework. The 
proposed method shows promising results in simulations with various practical current 
profiles.

 Optimization design of a parallel air-cooled battery thermal management system with 
spoilers[2].In this study, spoilers were installed in the distribution plenum and the cooling 
channel of a BTMS to improve its cooling performance. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
was utilized to analyze the airflow velocity and temperature fields of the battery pack with and without spoilers The effects of the quantity, position, height, and inclination angle of the spoiler in the distribution plenum, the width of the cooling channel, the presence of the spoiler in the cooling channel, and the length

  Thermal analysis of the battery pack: The first step in designing a temperature

 Selection of temperature sensors: Temperature sensors are necessary to measure the 
battery pack's temperature accurately. The selection of temperature sensors will depend on the 
specific requirements and design of the temperature control system.

 Development of control algorithm: The temperature controller's control algorithm will 
be developed based on the thermal analysis of the battery pack and the selected temperature 
sensors. The algorithm will use the temperature sensor data to regulate the cooling system and 
maintain the battery pack temperature within safe limits.

 Simulation of the temperature control system: The performance of the temperature 
control system will be simulated under different operating conditions to evaluate its 
effectiveness and efficiency. The simulation results will be analyzed to identify potential areas for improvement or optimization.
 
 Optimization and validation: Based on the simulation results, the temperature 
controller's design and parameters will be optimized to improve its performance and efficiency. The optimized temperature controller will be validated through further simulations and testing to ensure that it can effectively maintain the battery pack's temperature within safe limits.

 Overall, the methodology involves a combination of theoretical analysis, design, and 
simulation to develop and optimize a temperature controller for an EV battery system.
